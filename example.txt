Usage	tabulate [-h] [-W WIDTH_LIST] [FILE]
Description	Make fixed-width plaintext table with multi-line cell supports. Currently only support grid table, but it's trivial to adapt it to other layout once the table has been built. What plaintext table content is expected: <TAB> will be regarded as field delimiter, <LF> (or <CRLF> if on Windows) as row delimiter, and all the others as cell content.
FILE	table content from which to read; if FILE is not specified, the table content will be expected from stdin
-h, --help	show this help message and exit
-W WIDTH_LIST, --widths WIDTH_LIST	a comma-separated list of WIDTH (int) specifying the width of each column. Note, however, that the actual width of each field is (WIDTH-2) because of the left and right one-space paddings, and that the actual width of the entire table is (1+NF+sum(WIDTH)), NF being the max number of fields in each row, because of the column rulers.
